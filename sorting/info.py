# arranging data elements in some logical order is called sorting. 

# there are various soritng algorithms some of the major ones are:
'''
1. bubble sort -> done
2. modified bubble sort
3. selection sort
4. insertion sort
5. quick sort
6. merge sort
7. heap sort

'''
bubble sort

in this sort method we usually compare all the comaprisons till the comparisons are empty, 
meaning we check pair of values and if lower value is present we swap them.q

'''


'''
Modified bubble sort

in this sort method we usually compare all the comaprisons till the comparisons are empty, 
meaning we check pair of values and if lower value is present we swap them,q
but once the list is sorted we end the operations immediately

'''


'''
selection sort

in this sort method , it usually works as a human brain we check the lowest value and swap the 0th element with
it first then we check the second lowest value and update the 1st index value, like that we sort the list]
'''


'''
insertion sort

in this sort method , we consider the first element as always small and by holding on to that we start checking other values 
whether that is mall or greater if greater comes then we store that value and start comparing the remaining with the stored values until the list is stored!
