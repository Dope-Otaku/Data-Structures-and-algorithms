# Given an integer N, return the number of digits in N.


n = 4578

#first mistake len() function is only available for arrray data type
print(len(n))

# m = n
# count = 0


# while m > 0:
#     last_digit = m%10
#     count +=1
#     m = m//10

# print(count)

# #solved


# #optimal approach
# # completed


# import math

# a = n

# def count_digi(a):
#     cnt = math.log10(a) +1
#     return cnt

# print(count_digi(a))





#hi i have an update on this new year so from today on we will be pulling on a new self and be consistent throught whole year i promise
