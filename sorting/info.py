bubble sort

in this sort method we usually compare all the comaprisons till the comparisons are empty, 
meaning we check pair of values and if lower value is present we swap them.

Modified bubble sort

in this sort method we usually compare all the comaprisons till the comparisons are empty, 
meaning we check pair of values and if lower value is present we swap them,
but once the list is sorted we end the operations immediately
